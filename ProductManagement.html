		            <p>Product management is an organizational function within a company dealing with new product development, business justification, planning, verification, forecasting, pricing, product launch, and marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle. PM is one of the hottest positions in any technology company today, and hence the competition is equally fierce. In the following article, I will be taking you through the steps to follow in order to become a PM as an undergraduate fresher.
                    </p>

		            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Who can be a product manager?
					</h2>
		            <p>In order to be a product manager, you need a solid technological background as well as strong business acumen. If you are an engineering undergrad, you are already halfway there. But now it is important that you focus on your business side. If you find that your interests lie in the intersection of business and technology, that you are comfortable with people, interactions, stakeholder management, and bold decision making, you are the right fit for a Product Role.</p>
					<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">How to get a product role? 
					</h2>
		            <p>
						<ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
							<li><strong>Scenario: </strong>Unfortunately on-campus product roles are quite limited. A couple of companies offer Product Analyst (PA) roles such as Sprinklr and Simpl. This year was the first year that a company came for a Product Management (PM) role, Rivigo came for Associate Product Manager (APM) Role. PA is a stepping stone into Product Management, and it is the recommended pathway to follow if you are unable to grab a PM role directly.                            </li>
							<li> <strong>Off-campus Scenario:</strong> Contrary to most roles, the bulk of the opportunities in PM lie in off-campus recruitments. Most companies are looking to hire PM/APM interns and give PPOs, this was my case at Expedia as well. Some of the famous recruiters in this segment are Expedia Group, Park+, Zomato, Cred, Simpl, etc. Most startups/growth level companies will be open to recruiting undergrad PMs, hence it is important to build a strong and diverse network and to leverage that network as and when needed (if you are not active on LinkedIn, then you are already one step behind).</li>
							
						</ul></p>
		            
					<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hiring process</h2>
					<break>
					<p>Consulting firms follow a standardized procedure for recruiting on-campus.
						<ul style="list-style: numberes;">
							<li> Round 0: 		CV shortlisting </li>
							<li> Round 1: 		Aptitude Round (Optional)</li>
							<li> Round 2-3 : 	PM Interviews </li>
							<li> Round 4: 		Senior PM interview </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This is roughly the pattern most companies follow for PM recruitments. In addition to this, depending on the company, you could also have a final PM round with the CPO/VP of Product. 
                    </p>
                    <ul style="list-style: numberes;">
                        <li> In the PM interview, you will be tested thoroughly on your product sense, structural abilities, and stakeholder management. </li>
                        <li> Don't be surprised if you are asked to solve a product case study on the spot as well.                        </li>
                        <li> Prepare thoroughly for these rounds through the various PM books available and online resources such as youtube, medium, etc.                        </li>
                        <li> Find like-minded product enthusiasts and form a group where you can practice product breakdowns, guesstimates, product cases, etc.                         </li>
                        <li> It is also a good idea to participate in product breakdown competitions, case study competitions, and business competitions. This will help build your business acumen and streamline your thinking.</li>
                    </ul>
					<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Interview Tips
					</h2>
		            <p><strong>Confidence</strong> and <strong>clear communication</strong> are probably the two most important qualities of any good PM. Keep in mind PM is typically a front-facing job, i.e. you will spend a lot of time interacting with various departments and stakeholders in your company. So definitely remain calm, confident, and communicate effectively. </p>
					<p>Practice some basic problem solving and competency questions beforehand. Try to understand the <strong>product development </strong>process in detail (you can understand this by reading the books mentioned), this will be a big plus point.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another point that I would like to highlight, which most candidates actually overlook is - <strong>Research</strong> and <strong>Read</strong> about the company you are interviewing with and understand what is the Mission, Purpose, and Values associated with the company. Try to incorporate these sentiments into your answers, this will definitely give you an edge.</p>
