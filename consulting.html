		            <p>One of the most used phrases in the non-tech placement process that has everyone’s attention and eyes rolling is Consulting. Every second person preparing for placements, if asked which their preferred domain is, the answer without a doubt would be that they want to get into Consulting irrespective of having knowledge about the same. Let us demystify what consulting is all about and how to venture into it. 
					</p>

		            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Who is a Consultant and what is consulting all about ?
					</h2>
		            <p>A consultant is somebody who gives advice to a specific group of people. Just like a person, when not feeling well physically, takes health advice from the doctors, in the same way, when companies end up in a problem which they are not able to solve by themselves, they reach out to consulting firms. These consultants use a multi-pronged approach, involving primary and secondary research combined with business intuition from their extensive experience in the industry to understand business problems and provide recommendations. From turning around loss making businesses to managing highly important political election strategies, they offer a customized solution for every problem. <p>

					<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Scenario of Consulting Placements at DTU
					</h2>
		            <p>
						<p>The cohort at DTU attracts the top notch consulting firms which includes:</p>
						<break>
						<p ><ul style="list-style: numberes;">
							<li> Bain Capability Network </li>
							<li> BCG </li>
							<li> Everest Group </li>
							<li> EY-Parthenon </li>
							<li> EY </li>
							<li> KPMG </li>
							<li> PwC</li>
							<li> Praxis Global Alliance </li>
							<li> Trinity Life Sciences</li>
							<li> ZS</li>
						</ul></p>
						<!-- <img src="images/image_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"> -->
		            </p>
		            <p>Most of the consulting firms come on the DTU campus during the August-September phase in order to on-board the best talent at the earliest. The frequency of the firms coming in the subsequent months decreases as the academic year advances. These firms usually hire for the position of an Analyst and do offer a lucrative package. The work of a typical Analyst caters mostly to the backend office work, but a few firms do offer this role which is the amalgamation of both backend office and frontend office. Almost half of the crowd at DTU wish to get into consulting, thus in order to distinguish yourself from the rest of the crowd and grab an offer from the above-mentioned behemoths, it is very important to follow the right preparation strategy.
					</p>
					<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Hiring process</h2>
					<break>
					<p>Consulting firms follow a standardized procedure for recruiting on-campus.
						<ul style="list-style: numberes;">
							<li> Round 0: 		CV shortlisting (optional) </li>
							<li> Round 1: 		Aptitude Round </li>
							<li> Round 2-3 : 	Case Interviews </li>
							<li> Round 4: 		Partner/HR Round </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Round wise Preparation Recommendations
					</h2>
		            <p>Preparing for a consulting interview can be a little bit daunting. However, with the right resources and a proper strategy, one can ace it without a lot of hustle.
		            </p>
					<p>Most of the companies would have CV shortlisting as their first round. However, not all companies follow this practice. Consulting firms are known to shortlist candidates whose CVs show 3-4 ‘spikes’. Spikes can be any noteworthy achievements in the sphere of academics, extra-curriculars, projects or PORs that make your CV stand out from the rest. Try to keep this at the back of your mind while making your CV. 
					</p>
					<h3 class="ml-5">CV Tips</h3>
					<ul class="ml-5" style="list-style: numbers;">
						<li> Focus more on the results of your work more than how you did it. </li>
						<li> It always helps to quantify your work instead of using generic words like several, etc. </li>
						<li> Be specific while framing your points, use action verbs to signal strong impact. </li>
						<li> Bold out the important parts/ key figures and avoid using much of the technical jargon </li>
						<li> Having prior consulting experience via internships or societies will be a brownie point.						</li>
						<li> Your CV must be well formatted. Presentation skills matter and any flaw here puts you in 
							negative light.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The second round would comprise of an aptitude test which will include questions from Quant, Verbal, Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning. The difficulty level of questions would range from Easy to Medium. Aptitude Test is one of the most under-rated rounds of the placement process. Only the top 10% (on an average) of the folks who appear for the test, make it to the subsequent rounds. Thus, having a good grasp over apti is a must. Starting the preparation by mid June would definitely give a head-start. One can practice questions from websites such as Indiabix.com and Pariksha.com.
					</p>
					<p>
						The aptitude round would be followed by 2-3 Case Interviews consisting of guesstimates and case studies. Not many firms ask case studies during the interview since they are a bit time consuming, but guesstimates are a sure shot that would be asked.  Guesstimates can be generic or can be framed from something mentioned on CV. Cases, if asked, could be from the Profitability, Market Entry, or Pricing domain
					</p>
					<h3 class="ml-5">How to prepare for Case Interviews</h3>
					<ul class="ml-5" style="list-style: numbers;">
						<li> Form a case preparation group with your peers with whom you can carry out your case preparation journey. 
						<li> Use the interview transcripts of a casebook to set up a case between 2 people (or groups), and after solving the case, the solution should be looked into to gain a broader understanding of the approach and areas of improvement. Do not make the mistake of reading the cases in the book on your own. One person can take on the role of the ‘interviewer’ and the other, the ‘interviewee’. Only the interviewer must go through the case to understand the problem. After this, the ‘interviewer’ gives the case to the ‘interviewee’ who makes an attempt to solve the case. <li> Be specific while framing your points, use action verbs to signal strong impact. </li>
						<li> Maintain a separate notebook/document to take a note of the learnings from each case. If used properly, it can act as a single stop solution during the days leading to the interviews.
					</ul>
					<p>
						The final round would be either a Partner round or an HR round. Questions that are typically asked in this round include:
					</p>
					<ul style="list-style: numbers;">
						<li> Tell me something about yourself. </li>
						<li> Why do you want to join this firm?	</li>
						<li> What do you know about the firm? </li>
						<li> Why Consulting? </li>
						<li> What are your top 3 Strengths and Weaknesses ?	</li>
						<li> What are your 5 year plans?</li>
						<li> Any questions you want to ask? (asked in the end)</li>
					</ul>
